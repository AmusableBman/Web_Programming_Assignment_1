	What can I say about myself? Well, I can start by saying that I want to become a video game programmer. 
	Ever since I was a kid, I played video games. As I grew up, I figured that being able to make games 
	would be extremely rewarding. Video games, even today, are my primary hobby, and the game I'm currently 
	fiending is GTA V. I love working with computers, and I am most comfortable behind a keyboard.
